## Introduction

The **Large Scale Route Optimization** is an application designed to optimize delivery routes using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. This tool is particularly useful for logistics and manufacturing companies that need to plan the item-to-truck assignment for order delivery while minimizing overall delivery costs.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Route Optimization**: Automatically calculates the best routes for delivery.
- **Multiple Truck Types**: Supports various truck types with different capacities and costs.
- **Custom Constraints**: Allows users to define constraints such as available time and stop durations.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI for inputting parameters and viewing results.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WNormanTPN/Large-Scale-Route-Optimization
    Large-Scale-Route-Optimization
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

---

## Usage

1. **Open the application**.
2. **Input the parameters**:
    - Number of Ants
    - Number of Iterations
    - Truck Types and Capacities
3. **Click the "Run ACO" button** to start the optimization process.

---

## Visualization

Once the optimization process is complete, the application will visualize the optimized delivery routes, showcasing the best path for each truck.
